# Proof Of Concept - Mattermost Apps

This plugin is being developed to test some concepts of creating Apps, which do not rely on a Go executable being installed on the Mattermost server/cluster to extend functionality.  The Apps will not be able to use Go RPC to communicate with the Mattermost Server, only through the "App Plugin" which acts as a sort of proxy to the server's activity.

Apps will generally be communicating with our REST API and authenticating via OAuth.

This is a precursor to our "Mattermost Apps" and "Mattermost Apps Marketplace" we are currently researching.

## Getting Started

## Running the tests

`mattermost-plugin-apps` has two types of tests: unit tests and end to end tests.

### Unit tests

To run the unit tests, you just need to execute:

```sh
make test
```

### End to end tests

To run the end to end test suite, you need to have the Mattermost server project downloaded and configured in your system. Check the [Developer Setup](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/server/developer-setup/) guide on how to configure a local server instance. The tests will search for a `mattermost-server` folder in the same directory where the `mattermost-plugin-apps` is.

With the `mattermost-server` folder present, the only thing that needs to be done before running the tests themselves is to start the Mattermost docker development environment. The environment only needs to be started once, and then the tests can run as many times as needed. To start the docker environment, change to the `mattermost-server` project directory and run:

```sh
make start-docker
```

Change your directory back to `mattermost-plugin-apps` and run the end to end test suite with:

```sh
make test-e2e
```

## Usage
Use `apps provision-aws url` to provision an app in AWS. Pass the url of the archived app. 
Use `apps install-aws app_id ... ` to install provisioned AWS app.
Use `apps install manifest_url ...` to install HTTP app, we assume app is already provisioned somewhere.
