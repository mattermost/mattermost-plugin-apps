// Form defines what inputs a Call accepts, and how they can be gathered from
// the user, in Modal and Autocomplete modes.
//
// For a Modal, the form defines the modal entirely, and displays it when
// returned in response to a submit Call. Modals are dynamic in the sense that
// they may be refreshed entirely when values of certain fields change, and may
// contain dynamic select fields.
//
// For Autocomplete, a form can be bound to a sub-command. The behavior of
// autocomplete once the subcommand is selected is designed to mirror the
// functionality of the Modal. Some gaps and differences still remain.
//
// Requests for forms are calls, can use Expand, making it easy to generate
// forms specific to the user, channel, etc.
//
// When a dynamic select field is selected in a Modal, or in Autocomplete, a
// Lookup call request is made to the Form's Call. The app should respond with
// "data":[]SelectOption, and "type":"ok".
//
// When a select field with "refresh" set changes value, it forces reloading of
// the form. A call request type form is made to fetch it, with the partial
// values provided. Expected response is a "type":"form" response.

	// In Modal view, the field will be rendered as a list of buttons at the
	// bottom. Clicking one of them submits the Call, providing the button
	// reference as the corresponding Field's value. Leaving this property
	// blank, displays the default "OK".
